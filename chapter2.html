<h1>The Abandoned Factory</h1>
<h2>Dirty Floors</h2>
<p>
    Upon entering the building, the first thing that struck Carl was how empty this place felt.
    Many places are described as a ghost town but even this place felt uninhabitable for the undead.
    The roof looked caved in, and the floors had weeds growing in between the titles.
    All the machinery strewn about the assembly floor was in a state of disrepair.
    Whatever secrets lay dormant in this factory, Carl knew he was going to have to get his hands dirty.
    At first, he was overwhelmed with where to start. Where to even begin in this dilapidated building?
    Not given much time to ponder, something finally began to catch Carl’s eye. A hatch in the floor.
    It appears that it was at some point hidden but the weathering of the building revealed what used to be hiding in plain sight.
    Even more surprising was that the door appeared to be unlocked.
    Carl couldn’t have been given any more of a red arrow telling him where to go.
    So against his better judgment, Carl opened the hatch door and began to descend.
