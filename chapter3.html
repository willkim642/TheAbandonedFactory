<h1>The Abandoned Factory</h1>
<h2>What Was in the Basement?</h2>
<p>
    The first thing that struck Carl was that this underground room was illuminated.
    Well illuminated, by lights that surely wouldve died out in the decades since this factory was condemned.
    Carl didnt have much time to ruminate on this oddity as his attention soon shifted to a figure in the center of the room. 
    It was a smaller figure, humanoid but contorted. As Carl approached the figure, he began to make out more of the details. 
    Although he assumed that it was another person, Carls heart rate shot up as he realized how wrong he was. 
    What stood in front of him was an android of some kind. It wore the face of a girl but was tattered and peeling apart. 
    The robots eyes were darting all around and its head made small but instantaneous jitters.
    Its torso was made of some translucent material, showcasing distinctly fleshy human organs working in tandem with mechanical cogs.
    After the initial shock, Carl came to a realization.
    This android looked eerily similar to one of the people who had gone missing at the factory. 
    Perhaps this was the fate of all those missing people. 
    Could it be possible that the factory was shut down because people were beginning to figure out something was going on here. 
    That people were being turned into robots? Carls mind was racing trying to process all the information in front of him. 
    Then he realized the opportunity he had.
    He pulled his phone out of his pocket, frantically snapped a picture, and then immediately ran back the way he came. 
    With this, he would be the one to finally blow the whistle on the mystery of the factory.
    However, when he got to the front door, his heart sank when the door failed to open.
    There really was someone else in the building and they had just locked him in.
